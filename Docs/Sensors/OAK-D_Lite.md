# OAK-D Lite Stereo Depth Camera

I have a "_Kickstarter Edition_" OAK-D Lite stereo [camera](https://shop.luxonis.com/products/oak-d-lite-1).
It doesn't have an IMU, but otherwise should be identical to units produced later.

This guide describes how to run it under Ubuntu 24.04 and ROS2 Jazzy - first on an Intel 5 Desktop, an then on Raspberry 4 or 5 under the Ubuntu 24.04 Server and ROS2 Jazzy Base.

## Basic hardware test

The camera requires a quality USB3 cable and _prefers_ a USB3 socket, but will work if plugged into USB2 socket. 

After plugging it in, see if it shows up:
```
sudo dmesg
[11017.723133] usb 7-1: new high-speed USB device number 3 using xhci_hcd
[11017.916696] usb 7-1: New USB device found, idVendor=03e7, idProduct=2485, bcdDevice= 0.01
[11017.916708] usb 7-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[11017.916712] usb 7-1: Product: Movidius MyriadX
[11017.916715] usb 7-1: Manufacturer: Movidius Ltd.
[11017.916717] usb 7-1: SerialNumber: 03e72485

lsusb
Look for "ID 03e7:2485 Intel Movidius MyriadX"
```
Do not expect _/dev/video*_ descriptor appear, OAK-D uses different mechanism for accessing hardware.

Prepare and apply _udev_ rules:
```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03e7", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/80-movidius.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

## *Important:* Power consumption and USB connection requirements

In theory, OAK-D camera should negotiate available power from the USB port.

In my experiments, 5V power drain for my OAK-D LITE is as follows:
- 0.37A for stereo imaging, including PointCloud2 producing examples. The camera doesn't heat at all.
- 0.64A when running _mobilenet_ examples. Luke warm on touch.
- 0.84A when running _yolov4_ example. Warm on touch.
- variable 0.5A ... 0.84A when running _yolov4 spatial_ example. Warm on touch.

**Note:** USB 2.0 ports can [deliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hardware#:~:text=Allowable%20current%20draw) 100 to 500 mA, while USB 3.1/3.2 ports - 900 mA. That's if you are lucky, of course.

In practice, low quality or busy USB hubs wouldn't comply with OAK-D power requirements, which causes device pipelines crashing.

My OAK-D Lite was unstable when connected to most USB ports I tried (see *The "luxonis Device crashed..." bug* below).
Either on an Intel PC, or on Raspberry Pi 5, the best results (relative stability) is reached when there are no other devices connected to the same motherboard USB hub.

On the Raspberry Pi 5, when not running NNs, you may get lucky using lower USB3 (blue) slot, leaving the other empty.
Use a [quality USB hub](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJ95CR8X) to extend one of the USB2 (black) slots to connect other devices.

To ensure proper feeding of the camera from a 5V power source, Luxonis [sells](https://shop.luxonis.com/products/oak-y-adapter) an "OAK Y Adapter".
In fact, it is a wonderful example of a company making some extra $$ when they discover that their main product wouldn't work without a crutch ;-)

At the end I made a simple "power T-tap" from two USB-C [connectors](https://www.amazon.com/Connector-Adapter-5PcsFemale-Breakout-Compatible/dp/B0D9W8B97B).
It takes power from my robot's 5V bus, which can deliver many amperes. Once I put it in service, the camera became rock stable.

Connectios: *D+ to D+*, *D- to D-*, *GND to GND*. The 5V *on the camera side* and *common GND* go to the 5V power source. Capacitors optional.

**Note:**
- This simple wiring works at USB 2.0 speeds ("HIGH"). For actual USB 3.1 wiring refer to [this article](https://www.pshinecable.com/article/usb-c-cable-wiring-diagram.html).
- Another way to improvise the *power T-Tap* is to open a quality USB-C cable in the middle, cut the 5V (red?) wire and tap into it (and, if present, the ground wire). This preserves the "SUPER" speed ability.
- The camera can easily overheat if mounted in a tight space.
- OAK-D camera can adjust to available USB link speed and most scripts and launch files will report it (*"LOW", "FULL", "HIGH", "SUPER", "SUPER_PLUS"*). For USB2 speed will be "HIGH", for USB3 - "SUPER".
- Use a quality [USB-C "10Gbps" cable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWHTX1R7).

## Luxonis Software Installation

There's plenty of information on the [Luxonis Software](https://docs.luxonis.com/software/) site:
- [Examples](https://docs.luxonis.com/software/depthai/examples/)
- [Experiments](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments)
- [Spatial AI](https://docs.luxonis.com/software/perception/spatial-ai/)

For a quick test there is a collection of python [examples](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python), which is not needed for ROS2, but is useful for testing. 

It can be only installed if you have a **Desktop** edition of Ubuntu 24.04

Note the _virtual environment_ setup and activation.
```
mkdir ~/depthai
cd ~/depthai
git clone https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python.git
cd ~/depthai/depthai-python/examples
sudo apt install python3.12-venv

python3 -m venv ~/depthai/depthai-python/.env
source ~/depthai/depthai-python/.env/bin/activate
python3 install_requirements.py
```
Here is how to see video preview in a window (note Python _virtual environment_ activation): 
```
ros@machine:~$ source ~/depthai/depthai-python/.env/bin/activate
(.env) ros@machine:~$ cd ~/depthai/depthai-python/examples
(.env) ros@machine:~/depthai/depthai-python/examples$ python3 ColorCamera/rgb_preview.py
Connected cameras: [
    {socket: CAM_A, sensorName: IMX214, width: 4208, height: 3120, orientation: AUTO,
             supportedTypes: [COLOR], hasAutofocus: 0, hasAutofocusIC: 1, name: color},
    {socket: CAM_B, sensorName: OV7251, width: 640, height: 480, orientation: AUTO,
             supportedTypes: [MONO], hasAutofocus: 0, hasAutofocusIC: 0, name: left},
    {socket: CAM_C, sensorName: OV7251, width: 640, height: 480, orientation: AUTO,
             supportedTypes: [MONO], hasAutofocus: 0, hasAutofocusIC: 0, name: right}]
Usb speed: SUPER
Device name: OAK-D-LITE  Product name: OAK-D-LITE
```
Note the "_Usb speed_" value - it will be "_SUPER_" on USB3 and "_HIGH_" if plugged into an USB2 socket.

## Spatial demos in Python

Luxonis offers a good collection of examples which take advantage of stereoscopic vision and NNs.
It is documented [here](https://docs.luxonis.com/software/depthai/examples/spatial_mobilenet/).
```
ros@machine:~$ source ~/depthai/depthai-python/.env/bin/activate
(.env) ros@machine:~$ cd ~/depthai/depthai-python/examples

ls
spatial_calculator_multi_roi.py
spatial_mobilenet_mono.py
spatial_location_calculator.py
spatial_mobilenet.py
spatial_tiny_yolo.py
spatial_tiny_yolo_tof.py

# Run any of the above, for example:
./spatial_mobilenet_mono.py
```

There's also a collection of experimental code [here](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments)

## Configuration and Troubleshooting

There's a number of [environment variables](https://docs.oakchina.cn/projects/api/components/device.html#environment-variables), which can help reconfiguring camera system.

Use ```export DEPTHAI_LEVEL=info; export XLINK_LEVEL=info``` to display temperatures (default is "_warn_", see https://docs.luxonis.com/software/depthai/debugging/ for options).

Most operation parameters (frame size etc.) are convigured via arguments to launch files.

# ROS2 operation

## Installation

ROS2 Jazzy has binary distribution - a collection of [depthai_ros](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-ros) packages.
You may also want to install *[vision_msgs_rviz_plugins](https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs/blob/ros2/vision_msgs_rviz_plugins/README.md)* package
(*[vision_msgs](https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs)* should be already installed)
```
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-depthai-ros ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-vision-msgs-rviz-plugins

ros2 launch depthai_ros_driver camera.launch.py
```
By default, the */oak/rgb/image_raw* has 1280x720 size, and can be consumed raw or compressed. It is published at ~10 Hz, if run locally on Intel I7 Desktop.

With *depthai-ros* installation you are getting the following packages (under */opt/ros/jazzy/share*):
```
depthai_bridge
depthai_descriptions
depthai_examples
depthai_filters
depthai-ros
depthai_ros_driver
depthai_ros_msgs
```

## ROS2 examples

If you are working on a Desktop, the following example will show *pointCloud* in RViz2:
```
ros2 launch depthai_examples stereo.launch.py

   or

ros2 launch depthai_ros_driver pointcloud.launch.py use_rviz:=True
```    

Other examples produce topics which can be viewed in _rqt_ (beware of ~1A power conumption and possible overheating):
```
ros2 launch depthai_examples rgb_stereo_node.launch.py
ros2 launch depthai_examples tracker_yolov4_node.launch.py
ros2 launch depthai_examples tracker_yolov4_spatial_node.launch.py
ros2 launch depthai_examples mobile_publisher.launch.py
```
There are examples above that publish data from [_yolo_](https://encord.com/blog/yolo-object-detection-guide/) model. Note that camera resolution in the examples is downgraded to 300x300 or 480P, so the frame rate and CPU load becomes reasonable (I saw 10 FPS, 34 FPS).

Refer to [this guide](https://docs.luxonis.com/software/ros/depthai-ros/driver) for more.

## Spatial examples

The main attraction of having a stereo camera with AI capabilities is to be able to consume:
- RGB Image information (*sensor_msgs/msg/Image* topics)
- PointCloud2 data (*sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2* topics)
- Object tracking data (*vision_msgs/msg/Detection3DArray*, *visualization_msgs/msg/MarkerArray* topics)

Here is how to run one of the examples:
```
# runs mobilenet.
# launch RViz2, add panels to see:
#     /overlay topic (image with detections)
#     /oak/points (PointCloud2) - oak_rgb_camera_optical_frame
ros2 launch depthai_filters spatial_bb.launch.py
```
Note the _MarkerArray_ for `spatial_bb` topic - that's Luxonis way of tagging 3D objects,
different from standard _Detection3dArray_ [visualization](https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_msgs?tab=readme-ov-file#rviz-plugins).

![Screenshot from 2025-05-18 13-04-33](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d599bb9-1ff9-42e5-88dd-16a179cf082a)

Overall, it is worth spending time exploring *launch files* in these folders:
```
/opt/ros/jazzy/share/depthai_descriptions/launch
/opt/ros/jazzy/share/depthai_examples/launch
/opt/ros/jazzy/share/depthai_filters/launch
/opt/ros/jazzy/share/depthai_ros_driver/launch
```
**Note:**
- Trying to view _PointCloud2_ in _RViz2_ causes **~800 MBits/sec load** on your network. If it goes between RPi and Desktop - try Ethernet cable, not WiFi first.
- Luxonis uses custom messages (depthai_ros_msgs/msg/*) which don't seem to have corresponding RViz2 plugins.
- at this time Luxonis code wrongly places 2D values _in millimeters_ into 3D boundary box topics ("bbox"). This makes proper 3D visualization using *vision_msgs_rviz_plugins* impossible:

![Screenshot from 2025-05-12 12-00-28](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8925174a-0dc9-4c08-8502-8fa491b42561)

- My fork [here](https://github.com/slgrobotics/depthai-ros) tries to fix that 3D visualization problem (it is work in progress).

## Configuration files

There's a lot of configuring that's going on behind the scenes when you run launch files.
You can usually create a custom `.yaml` file and pass it as parameter, for example:

1. Take an original file:
```
/opt/ros/jazzy/share/depthai_filters/config/spatial_bb.yaml
```
2. Copy it as `my_camera.yaml` and make some changes, for example:
```
/oak:
  ros__parameters:
    pipeline_gen:
      i_enable_imu: false
    camera:
      i_nn_type: spatial
    rgb:
      i_enable_preview: true
      i_keep_preview_aspect_ratio: false
      i_fps: 10.0
      i_low_bandwidth: true
    nn:
      i_enable_passthrough: true
      i_disable_resize: true
    stereo:
      i_subpixel: true
      i_low_bandwidth: true
/spatial_bb_node:
  ros__parameters:
    desqueeze: true
```
Run the example (if in doubt, provide fulll path):
```
ros2 launch depthai_filters spatial_bb.launch.py params_file:=my_camera.yaml
```
Explore nodes and their parameters using `rqt`, `rqt_graph` and the following commands:
```
ros2 node list
ros2 param list /spatial_bb_node
ros2 param list /oak
ros2 param list /oak_container
ros2 param list /oak_state_publisher
ros2 param list /point_cloud_xyzrgb_node
ros2 param list /rectify_color_node
```
You can find another sample file [here](https://github.com/slgrobotics/depthai-ros/blob/jazzy/depthai_filters/config/spatial_bb.yaml).

Find complete list of parameters [here](https://docs.luxonis.com/software/ros/depthai-ros/driver/#DepthAI%20ROS%20Driver-List%20of%20parameters).

**Note:** 
- RGB Camera output normally goes through ISP (image signal processor)
as described [here](https://docs.luxonis.com/software/ros/depthai-ros/driver#DepthAI%20ROS%20Driver-Setting%20RGB%20parameters)
and [here](https://docs.luxonis.com/software/depthai-components/nodes/color_camera).
- NN video source is defined by `stereo.i_spatial_nn_source` (right or left B/W cameras)
as described [here](https://docs.luxonis.com/software/ros/depthai-ros/driver#DepthAI%20ROS%20Driver-Neural%20networks).

## Converting *PointCloud2* to *LaserScan*

It could be not practical to consume */oak/points* *PointCloud2* data due to high bandwidth required to pass it around and high CPU requirements for processing it.

There's a `pointcloud_to_laserscan` [package](https://github.com/ros-perception/pointcloud_to_laserscan) which can be used to produce a less voluminous *sensor_msgs/msg/LaserScan* message.

This is how to use it:
- Install *pointcloud_to_laserscan* package:
```
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-pointcloud-to-laserscan
```
- Use this [launch file](https://github.com/slgrobotics/depthai-ros/blob/jazzy/depthai_filters/launch/spatial_bb_laser.launch.py)

It will work with binary *dephai_ros*, if the launch file is placed properly, or with [my fork](https://github.com/slgrobotics/depthai-ros).
```
ros2 launch depthai_filters spatial_bb_laser.launch.py
```
You should see depth information presented as a LIDAR scan in RViz2, with only several Kbits/sec bandwidth consumption:

## Real life scenario

I have OAK-D Lite camera on my Plucky robot, which runs Ubuntu 24.04 Server - a "headless" configuration, no way to run examples that require Desktop.

So, to see the PointCloud (`ros2 launch depthai_examples stereo.launch.py`) I had to separate _RViz2_ from other nodes.

#### On Plucky Raspberry Pi 5:
```
cd /opt/ros/jazzy/share/depthai_examples/launch
sudo cp stereo.launch.py stereo.launch.node.py
sudo vi stereo.launch.node.py
```
Comment out line 219, which runs RViz2 GUI:
```
#ld.add_action(rviz_node)
```
Launch all nodes except "rviz_node":
```
cd ~/
ros2 launch depthai_examples stereo.launch.node.py monoResolution:=400p
```
`monoResolution:=400p` or `monoResolution:=480p` works. If skipped, a warning will be shown and default 480p will be used.

#### On the Desktop machine:
```
cd /opt/ros/jazzy/share/depthai_examples/launch
sudo cp stereo.launch.py stereo.launch.rviz.py
sudo vi stereo.launch.rviz.py
```
comment out lines 214...218, leaving "rviz_node" action:
```
    #ld.add_action(stereo_node)
    #ld.add_action(urdf_launch)

    #ld.add_action(metric_converter_node)
    #ld.add_action(point_cloud_node)
    ld.add_action(rviz_node)
    return ld
```
Now you can launch *rviz_node* alone:
```
cd ~/
ros2 launch depthai_examples stereo.launch.rviz.py
```
The _PointCloud2_ (_/stereo/points_ topic) is published at ~2 Hz.

A bonus */right/image_rect* topic shows the live stream from one of the OAK-D cameras (at 28..30 FPS).

Overall load on the WiFi link is around 200 Mbits/s (run `nload wlan0` on RPi).

## The "*luxonis Device crashed, but no crash dump could be extracted*" bug

At the time of this writing Luxonis ROS Jazzy code (or OAK_D LITE USB hardware) has a bug, which you will very likely experience.
It is related to camera's high power consumption and USB ports inability to deliver ~1A current to the device.

After a short time (between several seconds and several minutes) of opreation, the camera "driver" freezes and its pipelines would stop delivering data.

You can see that topics are not being published anymore.
If you interrupt your launch with _Cntrl/C_, you can see an error message cited in this section's header, for example:
```
[component_container-2] [ERROR] [1746405049.622991459] [oak]: No data on logger queue!

```
This is a known bug, and it looks like Luxonis knows about it:

https://discuss.luxonis.com/d/4835-oak-d-crashes-on-different-examples

my testing, I experience it a lot, even when using quality USB 3.2 cables and external power through a USB 3.2 Hub. 
It is random, sometimes the device "just works" with USB 2.0 connections and a very basic cable.
It can work on Raspberry Pi 5 better than on an Intel Desktop.

I am not equipped to debug it for real, but after trying a lot of combinations of machines, cables and USB connections,
I am convinced that the bug disappears when there's no other USB devices connected to hubs all the way to the machine.
For example, when I have all USB3 sockets unused, except for OAK-D LITE, the camera works fine forever.
But if I connect a card reader to the USB3 socket next to it, random crashes start happening.

The bug also disappears **when the camera is fed with 5V via an improvised "USB-C power T-tap"** (see above).

The other (software) way to deal with it is to write a custom node with a monitoring thread, which will recreate whole set of pipelines once data stops coming.
Here is my attempt to do just that: https://github.com/slgrobotics/depthai_rospi
