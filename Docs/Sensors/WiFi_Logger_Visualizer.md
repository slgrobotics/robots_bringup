## WiFi Logger Visualizer

There's a package created by Michael Wimble to log and visualize WiFi signal strength along robot's path.

The original is here: https://github.com/wimblerobotics/wifi_logger_visualizer

The fork I use for testing is here: https://github.com/slgrobotics/wifi_logger_visualizer

## WiFi testing and benchmarking

There are many useful commands to discover and measure performance of WiFi interfaces:
```
ip a
ifconfig -a
sudo lshw -C network
iwconfig wlan0   # use actual interface name here
iw dev wlan0 info
find /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/net/wireless
nload wlan0
```
When running my [Dragger](https://github.com/slgrobotics/robots_bringup/tree/main/Docs/Dragger) robot,
with RViz2 monitoring it on my desktop machine, I've got the following metrics from `nload wlan0`:
```
min: 19 Mbits/s
avg: 43 Mbits/s
max: 63 Mbits/s
```
There's no camera or pointcloud data going across WiFi yet, but the traffic is already very high.
It means that benchmarking and improving your WiFi should be at the top of your list.

Here are some [theoretical limits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005725/wireless/legacy-intel-wireless-products.html) for 802.11xx networks.
You probably will have either 802.11ac (1300 Mbits/sec, 200 Mbits/sec in reality) or 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) - over 300 Mbits/sec real throughput.

For benchmarking, _iperf3_ can be used. It must be installed on both ends of the connection being tested:
```
sudo apt install iperf3
```
During the installation it asks if the daemon should be started, answer _Yes_. Use the following commands to control the daemon:
```
systemctl status iperf3
sudo systemctl stop iperf3
sudo systemctl start iperf3
```
Then you can benchmark the connection to any computer where _iperf3_ daemon is running:
```
iperf3 -c plucky.local
  or
iperf3 -c plucky.local --bidir

The test above is between a Raspberry Pi 5 and an Intel I7 desktop. A mesh WiFi6 router is within 10' from the robot. A ROS2 robot might need 200+ Mbits/s bandwidth.

The realistic range of WiFi could be 50 meters indoors and about 100 meters outdoors, with 5 GHz links being less by at least 10 percent.


**Note:** Raspberry Pi 5 doesn't have SMA connector for WiFi antennas and uses a PCB trace for this purpose. 
Its "_antenna_" can be easily obstructed by metal active cooler and hats.
[Here](https://community.element14.com/products/raspberry-pi/f/forum/53868/how-good-is-wifi-in-raspberry-pi-5) is more info on this topic.

## WiFi 6 Mesh Networks and Travel Routers

A "_seamless whole-home coverage_" feature of contemporary WiFi 6 (802.11ax) Mesh routers allows client devices to select the router node with the strongest signal.

This works well, if the client device also supports that feature, but might cause poor performance otherwise.
Older client devices often connect to a far-away router node and keep that connection.
Mesh networks can be configured to assign router nodes to client devices ("preferred connection" setting), but that works only for stationary devices.

This issue can be solved by using a good WiFi 6 capable travel router in client mode.

## Improving your WiFi

While Raspberry Pi WiFi might be marginally adequate for in-home use, an outdoor robot has to do better.

My [Dragger](https://github.com/slgrobotics/robots_bringup/tree/main/Docs/Dragger) robot
has a [WiFi 6 Travel Router](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D41G5N95) in Client mode, with a 9/12V USB C [power adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8TBM2QM).

Raspberry Pi 5 is connected to the router via an Ethernet cable, so that the trafic goes through it. I keep the RPi's `wlan0` running, so that *wifi_logger* node could use it for signal strengh measurement. 

Here is how I configure Dragger's network, with `eth0` operating at fixed address (put your network real addresses there):
```
ros@dragger:~$ sudo cat /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml 
[sudo] password for ros: 
# This file is generated from information provided by the datasource.  Changes
# to it will not persist across an instance reboot.  To disable cloud-init's
# network configuration capabilities, write a file
# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
# network: {config: disabled}
network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
      eth0:
        optional: true
        dhcp6: true
        dhcp4: false
        addresses:
          - XXX.XX.X.152/24
        routes:
          - to: default
            via: XXX.XX.X.XXX
        nameservers:
          addresses:
            - XXX.XX.X.XXX
 
    wifis:
      wlan0:
        optional: true
        access-points:
          "aaaaaa":
              password: "xxxxxxx"
        dhcp6: true
        dhcp4: true
        nameservers:
          addresses:
            - XXX.XX.X.XXX
```
Near the garage router _iperf3_ shows 700+ Mbits/sec one-way data throughput, and about half bidirectional.

At about 35 meters from the garage router, here are the metrics:
```

The `ping` stays within 3..10 ms range. Connection becomes not reliable (for ROS2, at least) above the 35 meters range in my case.

As the result, Dragger can travel within the 35 meter range from the garage router and measure the "heatmap":

![Screenshot from 2025-04-09 20-14-39](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2394d7a5-2d2c-40e1-b79d-1ae8dd8c0083)

**Note:** I started ROS when Dragger was far from the router, and then moved towards it. That's why `/odometry/local` meters are negative on the plot.
