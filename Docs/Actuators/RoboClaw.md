## RoboClaw Motor Controller Setup

I don't have personal experience with [RoboClaw](https://www.pololu.com/category/124/roboclaw-motor-controllers) motor controllers,
so for useful information please refer to the source - Michael Wimble's repository:

https://github.com/wimblerobotics/ros2_roboclaw_driver

To use Raspberry Pi UARTs refer to the following [section](https://github.com/wimblerobotics/ros2_roboclaw_driver?tab=readme-ov-file#using-uarts-on-the-raspberry-pi-5)

There are also some alternative repositories:
- [alwinsdon](https://github.com/alwinsdon/ros2-roboclaw-encoder-system/tree/main/src/ros2_roboclaw_driver) - derived from Michael Wimble's work
- [sheaffej](https://github.com/sheaffej/roboclaw_driver2)

**Warning:** I will not accept any resposibility for damage to any device, person or property as a result of you following these instructions.
Neither will Michael Wimble, the original author. Use at your own risk.
