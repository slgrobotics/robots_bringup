## RoboClaw Motor Controller Setup

I don't have personal experience with [RoboClaw](https://www.pololu.com/category/124/roboclaw-motor-controllers) motor controllers,
so for useful information please refer to the source - Michael Wimble's repository:

https://github.com/wimblerobotics/ros2_roboclaw_driver

To use Raspberry Pi UARTs refer to the following section.

**Warning:** I will not accept any resposibility for damage to any device, person or property as a result of you following these instructions. Neither will Michael Wimble, the original author.
