# Actuators Folder

This section describes ROS2 _actuators_ and _motor controllers_ setup.

Please keep in mind that in Articubot architecture wheels are controlled by Arduino
as described [here](https://github.com/slgrobotics/robots_bringup/blob/main/Docs/MakeYourOwn/README.md#base-control---the-arduino-way).

But if you want to use a different controller type (e.g. [RoboClaw](https://www.pololu.com/category/124/roboclaw-motor-controllers)) - [this guide](https://github.com/slgrobotics/robots_bringup/blob/main/Docs/Actuators/RoboClaw.md) might help.
