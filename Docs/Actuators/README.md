# Actuators Folder

This section describes ROS2 actuators and motor controllers setup.

Please keep in mind that in Articubot architecture wheels are controlled by Arduino.

But if you want to use a different controller type (e.g. RoboClaw) - this section might help.

If you want to browse robot's code look here: https://github.com/slgrobotics/articubot_one
